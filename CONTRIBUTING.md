## How to run and make changes

Prerequirements: NodeJS 6+, NPM 3+.

Install needed deps via ``npm install`` (it also compiles browser version of UglifyJS).

To run development server you need to run ``npm run develop`` and open [http://localhost:8106](http://localhost:8106).

To compile the app (without dev server stuff) run ``npm run bundle``.
